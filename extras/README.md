# Chicago Brick: Extras

## What is an extra?
An extra is an optional addition to Chicago Brick that extends Chicago Brick with new functionality.  

## An extra should
- have it's own directory in **extras**
- maintain it's own dependencies (e.g., have a package.json)
- have a README.md describing the extra and any required setup

## An extra should not
- add dependencies to the Chicago Brick package.json
- be required for Chicago Brick to run
